WHAT'S STILL TODO
.................................................

Obviously the app needs user authentication, but that's not really in the scope of this project, as this is just a demonstration.
Aside to that, other things are still to do, like Docker support, more unit tests, REST demonstration, etc. An overview of what's currently TODO can be found in the TODO.txt file in the project root.
